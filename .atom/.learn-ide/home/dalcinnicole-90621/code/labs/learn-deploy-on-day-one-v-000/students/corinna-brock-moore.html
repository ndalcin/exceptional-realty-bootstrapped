              <p>I've moved more than a dozen times, but I grew up mostly in Massena, NY, a town that was so small that it was front page headlines when there were more people than cows in our county! It's on the other side of the Adirondack mountains, meaning that we had winter from September until June (and sometimes it snowed in June). I grew up thinking everyone wore the equivalent of down comforters outside every winter, and skiing days that were cancelled because it was too cold were a perfectly normal event. As an adult, I've managed the busiest Barnes and Noble Boston, been an executive assistant to several C-level executives, and (after moving from Boston to Tennessee) worked as assistant to a former Tennessee Supreme Court Justice. Then I found programming, and despite my first class being in C++ I fell in love and never looked back. I was a first cohort (000) immersive student, and now I'm a Learn Instructor.</p>
